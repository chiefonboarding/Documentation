# How to / Demo

At ChiefOnboarding, we currently don't do demos with potential customers. Demos take a lot of time and are quite similar between potential customer. You all come with the same goal, right? Improving your onboarding process. 

Underneath, you will basically find the transcript of a demo. You will get to see most of the features that our software provides and you can easily come back to it, if you want to look something up again. At the same time, we can keep working on features that you want. As always: if you have a question, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:hello@chiefonboarding.com) - we are fast at replying (often within an hour).


### Sequences
At ChiefOnboarding, we base everything around sequences. Sequnces are basically timelines which will map out the new hire's onboarding path. It looks like this:

![sequences]('./sequence.png')

Let's break it down a bit:

Sequences consist of blocks. We currently have 3 types of blocks:

- General blocks
   - Block before the new hire starts
   - Block after the new hire has started
   - Block based on the completion of a to do item
- Pre-boarding block
- Unconditioned block

Let's start with the pre-boarding block
Within this block, you can add items (also called 'pages') that your new hire will be able to see BEFORE they join the company. A pre-boarding page basically looks like this:

![preboarding edit]('./preboarding-edit.png')

And you can preview it with the preview button, it will look like this:

![preboarding view]('./preboarding-view.png')

You might have noticed the litle part at the bottom that says "Form options". You can actually build a custom form where you can allow your new hire to send some information back to you. Perhaps you want to know what their favorite snack is. 

The unconditioned block is there to add something to the new hire right away. Think about something that the new hire doesn't need to be notified off. Perhaps a random office policy or a to do item that needs to be completed right away.
