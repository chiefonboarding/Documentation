# How to / Demo

At ChiefOnboarding, we currently don't do demos with potential customers. Demos take a lot of time and are quite similar between potential customer. You all come with the same goal, right? Improving your onboarding process. 

Underneath, you will basically find the transcript of a demo. You will get to see most of the features that our software provides and you can easily come back to it, if you want to look something up again. At the same time, we can keep working on features that you want. As always: if you have a question, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:hello@chiefonboarding.com) - we are fast at replying (often within an hour).


## Sequences
At ChiefOnboarding, we base everything around sequences. Sequnces are basically timelines which will map out the new hire's onboarding path. It looks like this:

Let's break it down a bit:

Sequences consist of blocks. We currently have 3 types of blocks:

- General blocks
   - Block before the new hire starts
   - Block after the new hire has started
   - Block based on the completion of a to do item
- Pre-boarding block
- Unconditioned block

### The pre-boarding block
Within this block, you can add items (also called 'pages') that your new hire will be able to see BEFORE they join the company. A pre-boarding page basically looks like this:

![preboarding edit](/preboarding-edit.png)

And you can preview it with the preview button, it will look like this:

![preboarding view](/preboarding-view.png)

You might have noticed the litle part at the bottom that says "Form options". You can actually build a custom form where you can allow your new hire to send some information back to you. Perhaps you want to know what their favorite snack is. 

### The general blocks
There are three types of general blocks that you can choose from. You can create a block that triggers before the new hire starts. You could use this to create tasks (we will get to this later) for colleagues for things they need to do or send some emails/slack/text messages. 

The second type of general blocks are the ones that start after the new hire starts. These are marked in workdays, so it doesn't really matter if your new hire starts on a Monday or Thursday - ChiefOnboarding will skip the weekends and not bother the new hire on those days. Example: Monday is workday 1, next week Monday is then day 6. You can add a bunch more in these types of blocks (which we will get into in a bit).

All of the above blocks trigger at 8 AM in the new hire's timezone. Yes, ChiefOnboarding is totally remote friendly, we support multiple timezones and multiple languages. 

The third type of general block is a special one. You can have things happen based on a to do item. We will get into to do items in a bit, but basically what this is means is that you can wait for your new hire to complete a to do item and then it will trigger to create a new to do item for the new hire or perhaps send a message to a colleague. The posibilities are endless.

### The unconditioned block
You can only add one of these and you can add things in here that are automatically added to the new hire when you add the sequence to your new hire. You could add some random stuff in here that you new hire might need or that they need right from the start. Think of some policies and some default to do items.


## Templates
So what could we put in these blocks? We have created a few different types of templates that you could add in these. You could create those templates before you start to create the sequence, but you can also just add items as you go. 

### To do items
To do items look like this:
