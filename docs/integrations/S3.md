4. Keep everything at the default and click on 'Next'.
5. Click on 'Create bucket'.
6. In the bucket, go to 'Permissions' and then to 'CORS'.
7. Add this CORS configuration there (change YOURDOMAIN):

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>https://YOURDOMAIN</AllowedOrigin>
