# Deploy ChiefOnboarding 
Currently, two ways of deploying are supported out of the box. Docker and Heroku.

## Deploying

1. [Deploy through Docker](#Deploy-through-Docker)
1. [Deploy through Heroku](#Deploy-through-Heroku)

### Deploy through Docker
You can easily deploy ChiefOnboarding through Docker (Docker-compose). Make sure that both Docker and Docker-compose are installed and your server. Please note that some of the data below contain example values and should be replaced.

1. Point your domain name to your IP address.
2. Create a folder somewhere and then add this `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    restart: always
    image: postgres:latest
    expose:
      - "5432"
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=chiefonboarding
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    networks:
      - global

  web:
    image: chiefonboarding/chiefonboarding:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: web
    expose:
      - "8000"
    command: bash -c "cd back && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && python manage.py migrate && gunicorn back.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - global

  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.3.0-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - $PWD/site:/srv
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    networks:
      - global

  redis:
    restart: unless-stopped 
    image: redis:latest
    expose:
      - "6379"
    networks:
      - global

  celery:
    command: celery --workdir=back -A back worker --beat -l info 
    image: chiefonboarding/chiefonboarding:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - web
      - redis
    networks:
      - global

volumes:
  pgdata:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:

networks:
  global:

```
3. And then create a `.env` file in the same folder with values similar to these:
```
SECRET_KEY=somethingsupersecret
BASE_URL=https://test.chiefonboarding.com
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/chiefonboarding
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
ALLOWED_HOST=test.chiefonboarding.com
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=hello@chiefonboarding.com
```
4. Then we need to create a `Caddyfile` to route the requests to the server (change the domain name, obviously):
```
test.chiefonboarding.com {
  reverse_proxy web:8000
}
```
5. You can now run docker compose: `docker-compose up`. When you go to your domain name, you should have a blank page with a loading icon in the middle. That's correct, we need to do a few more things before everything is working.


### Deploy through Heroku
Please note: you will need to have an account at Heroku for this to work. Hosting at Heroku is more expensive than hosting it through Docker on a VPS. We will set it up to use two Hobby Dynos (which will be $14/month. A database upgrade might be necessary later on.

You will have to login to Heroku or create an account there. Then, you will need to click this link to start the process: [https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/chiefonboarding/ChiefOnboarding/tree/deploy](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/chiefonboarding/ChiefOnboarding/tree/deploy).
Heroku will then ask you for some details. Please be careful to put them in correctly, otherwise your app will not start.

The `app name` can be anything you want (so long it is available).

Under `config vars` you will have 5 items. Before you fill in anything: decide whether you want to use a Heroku subdomain `<app name>.herokuapp.com` or your own domain `onboarding.yourcompany.com`. Your own domain doesn't have to be a subdomain.

`ALLOWED_HOST`: This needs to be the domain you want to use for the platform. Either your Heroku subdomain or your own subdomain. You can add multiple urls if you want to make it available through multiple urls (example: `domain.example.com, domain2.example.com`). Do **not** add the protocol (`https://`) before the url.

`BASE_URL`: This is the url that will be used in multiple places, such as redirects and password reset emails. For this variable, you should add the protocol. Such as `https://onboarding.yourcompany.com` or `https://<app name>.herokuapp.com`. You can only add one url here.

`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: This is used for sending emails (you will need to [set up emails](https://docs.chiefonboarding.com/integrations/Email.html) if you want this to work). You can put it like this: `Company Onboarding <hello@yourcompany.com>` or `hello@yourcompany.com`.

`SECRET_KEY`: You can't change this and shouldn't. It will be generated by Heroku. It's used for signing cookies, encrypting data etc.

`SSL_REDIRECT`: Leave it at `True`. This is used to redirect all traffic from `http` to `https`. 

Click on `Deploy app`. You should see this when it's done (this might take a few minutes):

![heroku deploy done](/heroku-deploy-done.png)

If you are using a custom domain: go to the settings area and look for the 'domains' part:

![heroku settings domain](/heroku-settings-domain.png)

Then click on 'Add domain' and enter your domain name. You will get a DNS target to point your domain name to in your DNS settings:

![heroku new domain](/heroku-new-domain.png)

You might get a red icon now next to your domain name. It might take a bit of time to get your domain validated (DNS is often cached). Just wait for a bit and try to refresh it until it becomes green:

![heroku click recheck](/heroku-click-recheck.png)

Once that's done, you are ready to put in a bit of data and then you are done!

## Creating the first account and adding default data
First start a python/django shell session with this:

Docker:

```
docker-compose run web python3 manage.py shell
```

Heroku: click on the 'more' button (top right in your dashboard) and then click on 'console'. Fill in 'bash' then do this:

```
cd back
python manage.py shell
```

Then run this (please replace the items that are marked with < and >):

```
from organization.models import Organization
from users.models import User
Organization.objects.create(name="<organization name>")
User.objects.create_admin("<first name>", "<last name>", "<email>", "<password>")
# example: User.objects.create_admin("Stan", "Doe", "hello@chiefonboarding.com", "Somethingsupersecret")
```

At last, we need to add some default data.

Docker:

```
docker-compose run web python3 manage.py loaddata welcome_message.json
```

Heroku: click on the 'more' button (top right in your dashboard) and then click on 'console'. Fill in 'bash' then do this: 

```
python manage.py loaddata welcome_message.json
```
If you want to add a bunch of example data (recommended) then add `all.json` at the end of the previous line (so: `python manage.py loaddata welcome_message.json all.json`).

That's it! Happy onboarding!
