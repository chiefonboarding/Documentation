# Introduction

This is the ChiefOnboarding documentation. It's hosted on Github and you can easily propose changes through pull requests. You can find [the source of these docs here](https://github.com/chiefonboarding/docs). If you have any questions about installing or configuring ChiefOnboarding, then please create an issue in [the repo that contains the source code ChiefOnboarding](https://github.com/chiefonboarding/ChiefOnboarding). 

You will probably find that some of the integrations require quite a lot of permissions from the third party. I want to emphasise here that ChiefOnboarding does not ping home, ever! We will never receive any information from your server (unless you provide it to us voluntarily). Privacy is important to us.

**Note:** All of the integrations are independent. They do not rely on another integration. Feel free to skip the ones you don't want. This is probably pretty obvious, but every time there is written `YOURDOMAIN`, you should replace this with your domain name, example: `onboarding.chiefonboarding.com` (so without `http://`/`https://`).
