# Q&A

### I am not using Let's encrypt, can I still redirect everyone to https?
Yes, just set `SSL_REDIRECT` to `True` in your environment variables. This will redirect http queries on application level.

### Open source projects often die, how can we be sure ChiefOnboarding doesn't?
At the bare minimum: as long as we have customers, we are going to keep all packages up to date and provide security patches (where necessary). Also, with every customer we get, we can directly invest back into the product and create features that you want. We have been in business since 2016. 

### I don't want the hosting package, but still want to support you. How do I do that?
The easiest way is to just spread the word. You might just refer a few businesses that are interested in our hosted package and that helps us out a lot! If you know how to develop software (specifically Django/VueJS), then you could pick up an issue and create a pull request for it.
